         "Technically your best option for any "appliance-style" OS like
         FreeNAS or ESXi is a SATA DOM (Disk on Module) or SSD, as they'll
         be more reliable.

         The USB drive is the economical choice to avoid the moving parts
         and wasted space of an HDD, since FreeNAS is only ~4GB in size 
         (although 9.3 uses ZFS for its boot system, so it will grow with
         each update snapshot) and it doesn't make sense to use a 250GB+
         drive for that.

         For a homelab, use a USB drive and back up your configuration
         regularly. For anything more commercial you should ante up to
         SATA DOM or SSD."
